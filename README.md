# Book-Recommendation-System

This project focuses on developing a personalized book recommendation system that leverages advanced machine learning techniques to enhance the accuracy and relevance of book suggestions for users. The system employs a hybrid approach that integrates various algorithms, including Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Ridge Classifier, and Random Forest, alongside a novel combination of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
The hybrid SVD-KNN model demonstrates significant improvements, achieving:
Precision: 89.35%
Recall: 59.01%
F1 Score: 71.30%
